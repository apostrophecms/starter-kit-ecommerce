The E-commerce Starter Kit project is a result of a collaboration between Apostrophe CMS and its partner agency Corllete. It aims to offer a solid ground for Apostrophe CMS e-commerce applications. It's built with the following in mind:
- Provide a solid ground for Apostrophe e-commerce applications and showcase best practices
- Allow developers to easily extend and adapt it to their needs
- Allow developers to turn it into a real-world, production ready application in a matter of minutes
- Keep it simple and newcomer friendly

This documentation outlines the application architecture, key integration points and provides tips about further extending, scaling and personalizing the application to meet any individual project requirements.

A guide to "make it yours" - from color scheme and Tailwind CSS specifics to extending and modifying the UI, can be found in [the Branding and UI](/developer/branding-and-ui) section.

## Component Library (aka Design System)

This project was built using a 3rd party open source module - Corllete Design System. It is not integrated and installed by default. It was used in developing the application UI in isolation, according to design system rules and Figma Prototype. Installation and integration instruction and link to the Figma sources can be found in the [Design System](/developer/design-system) section.
