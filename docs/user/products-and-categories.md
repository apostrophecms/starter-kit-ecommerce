The Apostrophe CMS E-commerce Starter Kit comes with Product and Product Category pieces and pages. Be sure to check out the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) section first for a list of tips and recommendations as first steps in building your site content, including receipes for content taxonomy.

## Product Category

You can create new categories by either using the quick menu (the blue plus button at the top of the page) and choosing "Product Category", or by using the "New Product Category" button after clicking the "Content - Product Categories" administration menu item.

Beside the essential fields, when adding a new category piece, you can also:

- Add "Publication Date" to control the order of the categories when shown in the page or widget. Categories having newer publication date will be shown first. If you leave that field empty, it will contain the date when the category was created.
- From the "Page" tab, you can control the heading type of every category view page via the "Header Type" field. By default, a "Title" will be set, resulting in the default Title/Tagline heading. You can choose "Hero" and you'll see a new area for adding the Hero widget.

::: tip
You can choose your user experience - manage your widgets within the page itself or inside the Page Editor. Keep in mind, that the Heading area will be visible once you choose the "Hero" heading type, which can happen only in the Page Editor.
