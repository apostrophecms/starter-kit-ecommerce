This section contains a list of tips and recommendations as first steps in building your site content.

## Before you start

Take a moment to think about the structure of your product catalog and generally - your site. Outline the pages needed, beside the essential product related ones. 

### Content taxonomy

The tag based product taxonomy requires a bit of planning. You need to understand how it works first. The taxonomy is based entirely on tags. Tags are controlled via the "Content - Content Tags" administration menu. Currently they are used to:
- filter products in the Products widget
- assign products to categories

Here is how product categories work:
- when you create a product, you assign any number of tags to it
- when you create a product category, you also assign any number of tags to it
- when browsing a category page, only products that have at least one tag in common with the category are shown

Additionally, when adding a product widget to any page, you can filter the products shown by up to ten tags. This allows you to create landing pages for promotions, or just to show a subset of products on any page.

Based on that knowledge, you need to decide on the following:
- what are the product categories
- what tags will be used in the product categories in order to filter products for each category
- what tags will be used to filter products in the Products widget, thus on the Home page and the eventual future landing (promo) pages

The output of this planning should be a list of essential tags, that can be created in advance. This will allow you to assign them to products and categories as you create them, thus saving time and effort. It's also a good way to further scale your product catalog in the future.

For example, you might have tags "Kids", "Shoes" and "September Sale". This would allow you to have product categories such as "Kids", "Shoes" and/or "Kids Shoes". You can also create a landing page for the September Sale by adding a Products widget to a Custom Page, and filtering the products by the "September Sale" tag. 

If the appropriate tags are added to the products in advance (while creating them), you'll save a lot of forth and back when further arranging your site content.

## Essential Pages

The following pages are essential for your site to function properly, and should be created as a first step:

- **Products Page**: this page is the landing page for your products. You need to create it once, using the "Product" type from the Type dropdown in the page editor.
- **Product Category Page**: this page is the landing page for your product categories. If you don't plan to use categories, you can skip this step. Otherwise, you need to create it once, using the "Product Category" type from the Type dropdown in the page editor.

Learn more about products and categories in the [dedicated section](./products-and-categories.md).

You might also want to create placeholders (empty pages) for any other content you would initially like to have on your site. For example "About Us", "Contact Us", "Terms and Conditions", etc. You can create them as Custom Pages, and add content to them later. You can create a custom page by selecting the "Default" type from the Type dropdown in the page editor. Learn more about custom pages in the [dedicated section](./custom-pages.md).

## Configuration

Use the top right configuration (cog) button to access the site configuration. Here you can:
- create and manage the main navigation menu
- control various header related features
- create and manage the footer navigation menu
- add and manage social links (shown in the footer)
- brand your site with a brand name, logo and a favicon

## Home Page

You should edit your Home page after your entire site content (and most importantly - your [product catalog and categories](./products-and-categories.md)) is in place. It is managed in a similar to a [custom page](./custom-pages.md) way.

## SEO

Add the SEO related configuration while creating your content. Learn more in the [dedicated section](./search-and-seo.md).
